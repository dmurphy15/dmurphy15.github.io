      <p>Goals for the Summer:</p>

<ul>
<li>To gain experience in web development, including learning some JavaScript</li>
<li>To practice working on projects that serve a greater purpose, instead of mere assignments, and see how these projects are coordinated in a real-world environment.</li>
<li>To see what it's like to hold a job in a computer science related field</li>
<li>To check out what other projects people are carrying out at Serre Lab</li>
<li>To gain a better idea of what machine learning is all about</li>
<li>To (hopefully) make a significant contribution to the project we will be working on by the end of the summer</li>
</ul>
